What is this ?
==============

SympaCompta is a python toolkit aiming at simplfying your personnal accounting workflow by
packing easy-to-use tools as python modules. You can build custom scripts and interfaces on top
of that, for example to manage transactions, generate various reports, or integrate data from
other sources (stock markets for instance).
